Second Milestone Project - Code Institute 

# Student Details

Name: Szebasztian Pintyer

Student ID: 715159

Institution: City of Bristol College (https://www.cityofbristol.ac.uk) in partnership with Code Institute (https://codeinstitute.net) 

Location: Bristol, UK.

# Introduction

Welcome to my second readme file and my second website project.

This project is represening an online school for music and piano practice, named Keytarschool. The name is a mixture of guitar and keyboard creating the "keytar" name, because of the look of the instrument and the hero image potrays a girl playing the keytar on the landing page of the website.

The projects objective is to make a front end - interactive website with HTML5, CSS3 and JS(ES6) with a focus on making the website mobile phone user friendly.

Note * - * the forms on the website have no backend, therefore all the entered data (name,email) won't be stored and actual registration is not possible. *
Note * - * as mentioned, there is no backend therefore the subscriptions won't work either, instead a modal shows up that leads to registration page.*

## User stories

### First time visitor goals :

As a first time visitor, I want information about the features of the website, pricing of subscription and what is included in the product package and to persuade people of interest in music to join the website and  help them develop a new skill.

- At the top-left of the page the logo of the school can be found and at the top-right the menu options are available,
which makes it easy to navigate through the pages of the site.

- At the bottom of every page, in the footer section, the user can select the social media pages and can follow the school, share posts with others or raise awarness of the existence of the community and website. 

- The user while scrolls down the pages of the site, the menu bar is fixed and follows the users page view, so tha navigation across the web site is easy and accessible.

- On the index page, the first time user has a review section, where existing members share their experience about the site, which further makes the product transparent and should further encourage registration.

- The first time user can send a mail/message or further questions to the owner of the school by filling out the form on the "Contact" page. 
  The user will be notified by an auto-reply email that their query has been sent and someone from the team will contact the person ASAP.
  This form can be used by existing members as well to contact customer service.

- The first time user has access to a Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) section where gathering more information is possible before making a decision to join the online school.

- After the Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) section, the first time user can choose from three subscription options. In order to complete the subscription, the user will be offered to register in order to join the school or cancel the subscription.

- On the login page there are two forms available to choose from, where the first form is a registry form for new members and by clicking the "Login" text at the bottom of the form, the existing member can access the login section and enter the website.

### Frequent user goals :

- As a frequent user/member I want to have a interactive piano with built in metronome so practice is possible, learning the notes is easy, with the function to hide and show notes on the piano the user can practice the name and location of the notes on the instrument.

- The first time user has access to a Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) section where gathering more information is possible before making a decision to join the online school.

- Goal to keep the user returning 

# Design

## Abstract :

While designing the website, I had in mind 2 colours Purple and Green, as these colours make the Hero image "Keytar Girl".
The website revolves around the combination of these colours and their different shades.

According to some studies the purple is associated with the following : promotes harmony of the mind and the emotions, contributing to mental balance and stability, peace of mind, a link between the spiritual and the physical worlds, between thought and activity. 

While the colour green is associated with : a feeling of abundance and is associated with refreshment and peace, rest/ regenaration and security.

The logo is using "Kablammo" font, which is provided by using Google fonts API. This font style is wacky and out of ordrinary giving the websites name/logo an attractive look, which is meant to please the aesthetic visual senses of the visitor.

Also on the menu section, the current visited page is highlighted with the colour green and border bottom, to indicate to the user on which page they are currenlty visiting, which further contributes to positive and easy website navigation.

## Piano : 

The goal was to design a piano, that resembles real life electric piano.
The top side of the piano is divided into to sections 1. Metronome on the top left and 2. Presets on the top right.

On the top-left side the user can interact with a functioning metronome to practice timing and rhythm, which includes a Beats Per Minute (BPM) adjusting setting that goes from 60BPM to 180 BPM, following with a "START" and "STOP" button for the clicking sound of the metronome and finishing by a Beat Per Measure setting, that goes from 1 beat per measure up to 6 beats per measure.

On the top-right side the user can adjust the preset settings of the piano, which are the volume of the piano and hide/show option for the piano key names.

<img width="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PSebastian96/pjt2-keytarschool/assets/123810890/c8813509-5266-4838-8cea-331a0b997e9f">

- Testing the alert message if the user tries to get over 180 BPM:

<img width="673" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PSebastian96/pjt2-keytarschool/assets/123810890/7429bba2-2599-45e5-8b8e-0ac9df70672c">

- Testing the show/hide notes button :
1. Visible (default)
<img width="873" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PSebastian96/pjt2-keytarschool/assets/123810890/5e457997-080c-42b6-8a37-e1d5718ef594">

<img width="851" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PSebastian96/pjt2-keytarschool/assets/123810890/f7750ed2-5476-4834-9040-7137fc923530">

- Testing the keys if the script makes them play on click :

<img width="857" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PSebastian96/pjt2-keytarschool/assets/123810890/98e95ba0-d51c-4125-9370-817eca3bcbb4">

### Debugging the metronome : 

<img width="946" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PSebastian96/pjt2-keytarschool/assets/123810890/4309d479-2bc7-4c47-878e-626d30f77588">

- The problem was a mixture of incorrect syntax and import error from the timer.js to metronome.js, the metronome script could not access the timing/beat from timer.js. The solution was to add the correct syntax and connect timer.js with metronome.js by adding the attribute [type = "module"]to the script tag in piano.html file.

## Jest

- Jest is a JavaScript testing framework [https://jestjs.io]
- Official documentation [https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started]
### Testing the playClick() function
### Counting should be 0, when a new round of beat is starting - restart the count.
<img width="952" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PSebastian96/pjt2-keytarschool/assets/123810890/44b874dc-8b64-4ae9-af09-e784197d9443">

### - 1st count to start playing the click1 sound.
<img width="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PSebastian96/pjt2-keytarschool/assets/123810890/18164357-ff97-42b3-8f6b-b7f61abf8376">

### - Rest  of the count to start the playing the click2 sound.
<img width="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PSebastian96/pjt2-keytarschool/assets/123810890/9caf065b-0e42-43ae-83c5-a36651ba0ff3">

### Known bugs :

- Opera browser is not rendering the css property [accent-color] on the volume input range, thus making it look dull in the browser, while chrome loads it with no issues.
- Depending on the browser loading speed, sometimes the piano sound is delayed after a key is pressed.

### Further Testing
- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Mozilla browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and Samsung Galaxy S10+ , Nokia 4.2 .

### Emailjs API :

- Emailjs - [https://www.emailjs.com]

- Emailjs offers an emailing service for websites. This includes two type of API's : 1. free and personal use of up to 200 session/month and 2. a business API.
  For this project I have signed up for the free/personal use of email service with 200 available sessions/month.
  This API is allowing the developer to receive emails from the forms which are designed for the website for various pourposes.
  The emailjs API makes the following possible:
   
   - The user can fill out the contact form with their details and their query or message.
   - The API connects the "business" or personal email account (gmail,outlook etc) with the websites form and makes it possible to receive the visitors inputs from 
     the same form.
   - API also offers an auto reply mode and it's content is customizable and can fit any business/personal needs for emailing.

 - For any further details about the application of this API, please find the details in the official documentation of the emailjs API [https://www.emailjs.com/docs/].

### Environment Used

1. Github - (https://github.com)
    - Was used to store the repository and files for the project.

2.  Codeanywhere - (https://codeanywhere.com)
    - was used to code and edit code for the project.
