# Introduction

Welcome to my second readme file and my second website project.

This project is represening an online school for music and piano practice, named Keytarschool. The name is a mixture of guitar and keyboard creating the "keytar" name, because of the look of the instrument and the hero image potrays a girl playing the keytar on the landing page of the website.

The projects objective is to make a front end - interactive website with HTML5, CSS3 and JS(ES6) with a focus on making the website mobile phone user friendly.

Note * - * the forms on the website have no backend, therefore all the entered data (name,email) won't be stored and actual registration is not possible. *

# User Experience (UX)

- Who is this website for ?

The target audience are people who would like to learn music theory and practice/interact with digital piano.

- Why people visit the website ?

Visitors of the website can register and become a member, get lessons, play music and learn a new skill.

- About the website:

The website is a presentation a fictional online music school that teaches the skills to play the key based instruments such as piano/synthesizer/keytar.

### First time visitor goals :

As a first time visitor, I want information about the features of the website, pricing of subscription and what is included in the product package and to persuade people of interest in music to join the website and  help them develop a new skill.

- At the top-left of the page the logo of the school can be found and at the top-right the menu options are available,
which makes it easy to navigate through the pages of the site.

- At the bottom of every page, in the footer section, the user can select the social media pages and can follow the school, share posts with others or raise awarness of the existence of the community and website. 

- The user while scrolls down the pages of the site, the menu bar is fixed and follows the users page view, so tha navigation across the web site is easy and accessible.

- On the index page, the first time user has a review section, where existing members share their experience about the site, which further makes the product transparent and should further encourage registration.

- The first time user can send a mail/message or further questions to the owner of the school by filling out the form on the "Contact" page. 
  The user will be notified by an auto-reply email that their query has been sent and someone from the team will contact the person ASAP.
  This form can be used by existing members as well to contact customer service.

- The first time user has access to a Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) section where gathering more information is possible before making a decision to join the online school.

- After the Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) section, the first time user can choose from three subscription options. In order to complete the subscription, the user will be offered to register in order to join the school or cancel the subscription.

- On the login page there are two forms available to choose from, where the first form is a registry form for new members and by clicking the "Login" text at the bottom of the form, the existing member can access the login section and enter the website.

### Frequent user goals :

As a frequent user/member I want to have a interactive piano with built in metronome so practice is possible, learning the notes is easy, with the function to hide and show notes on the piano the user can practice the name and location of the notes on the instrument.

### Emailjs API :

- Emailjs - [https://www.emailjs.com]

- Emailjs offers an emailing service for websites. This includes two type of API's : 1. free and personal use of up to 200 session/month and 2. a business API.
  For this project I have signed up for the free/personal use of email service with 200 available sessions/month.
  This API is allowing the developer to receive emails from the forms which are designed for the website for various pourposes.
  The emailjs API makes the following possible:
   
   - The user can fill out the contact form with their details and their query or message.
   - The API connects the "business" or personal email account (gmail,outlook etc) with the websites form and makes it possible to receive the visitors inputs from 
     the same form.
   - API also offers an auto reply mode and it's content is customizable and can fit any business/personal needs for emailing.

 - For any further details about the application of this API, please find the details in the official documentation of the emailjs API [https://www.emailjs.com/docs/].
